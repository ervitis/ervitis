### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer & Software Architect & DevOps :heart:

Currently, working at HRBrain.

Love cooking, crossfit and craft beer. My first computer was an AMSTRAD:

Then I had an IBM Pentium 486DX2 with 20Mb of RAM!!

I began with PHP5, then Python2.5, Java, PHP again with some frameworks like Silex or Symfony2 & Python3, jQuery, NodeJS and vanilla javascript (and other frameworks like AngularJS or Angular), Scala and (finally?) Golang.
I have used a lot of CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Travis, Circle, GoCD and Gitlab CI. Also, I have used Ansible, Terraform (little), Packer, Vagrant and Docker for building and hardening images and upload them into our AWS infrastructure.
My favourite IDE is any product from Jetbrains.
I think Git saved and is saving a lot of work, and I love working with it.

I'm still playing video games in my [megadrive](https://retrokai.store/43-large_default/sega-mega-drive-2-euusjap.jpg).

My superpower: I can speak Japanese (a little).
